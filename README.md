# Trading Platform - Node.js Backend

Welcome to our trading platform powered by Node.js! This platform serves as a hub for users to engage in item trading, specifically focused on cars. Below is a brief overview of the key features and technologies used.

## Key Features

1. **User Authentication**
   - Users can create accounts and securely log in.
   - Account information is stored locally in a MongoDB database.

2. **Listing Cars for Trade**
   - Authenticated users can post details about the cars they have available for trade.
   - These listings are showcased to other users on the platform.

3. **Trade Proposals**
   - Users can view and manage trading proposals they have received and those they initiated.
   - Each user has a session upon login, providing a personalized experience.

4. **Trade Management**
   - Users can accept or decline trade offers.
   - They can also delete their own listed items.
5.  **MVC (Model-View-Controller):**
   - **Model:** Data models for users, offers, items, and cars are defined in the `models` directory.
   - **View:** Front-end assets in the `public` directory enhance the user interface.
   - **Controller:** Express.js routes (`routes` directory) and middleware functions (`middlewares` directory) manage data flow.

## Technologies Used

1. **Node.js Backend**
   - The server-side logic is implemented using Node.js, providing a scalable and efficient backend.

2. **MongoDB Database**
   - User account information is stored in a MongoDB database, offering a flexible and scalable solution.

3. **Express.js**
   - The web application framework Express.js is used for building the RESTful APIs and handling HTTP requests.

4. **Session Management**
   - Sessions are implemented to provide a personalized experience for each user upon login.

5. **Middleware Functions**
   - Middleware functions, including authentication (`auth.js`) and validation (`validator.js`), ensure secure and valid interactions.

6. **Public Assets**
   - The `public` directory contains static assets, such as videos, CSS files, and images, enhancing the visual appeal of the trading platform.

## What I Learned

While developing this trading platform, I gained valuable insights into several aspects of web development and project management. Some key takeaways include:

- **User Authentication**: Understanding how to securely handle user authentication, store user data, and manage sessions for a personalized user experience.

- **Database Integration**: Learning to integrate MongoDB as the database backend, exploring the benefits of a NoSQL database for flexible data storage.

- **Middleware Functions**: Implementing middleware functions for authentication and validation to ensure the security and integrity of user interactions.

- **Express.js Framework**: Utilizing Express.js for building robust and efficient RESTful APIs, handling routing, and managing HTTP requests.

- **Project Structure**: Organizing project files and directories to maintain a clean and scalable structure, making it easier to manage and expand the application.

- **Frontend Assets**: Managing static assets in the `public` directory, including videos, CSS files, and images, to enhance the visual presentation of the trading platform.


## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` to install all the necessary modules.
3. Set up a MongoDB database and update the connection details in the configuration.
4. Run the application with `node app`.
