  "model": "Camry",
  "brand": "Lexus",
  "details": "Toyota didn't settle for upgrading just the looks of the 2019 Camry, they gave it a ride that feels smoother and sharper through the harmony of the Camry's independent McPherson strut front suspension. The standard engine, a 2.5L 4-cylinder, utilizes the D-4S dual-injection system, however, select models can be upgraded to a 3.5L V6 engine. Both engine options come paired to a newly developed Direct Shift 8-Speed Automatic Transmission, which improves acceleration from a stop and fuel efficiency. It also provides a smoother ride at highway speeds. When paired with the sophisticated multi-link rear suspension, you can be confident that you are ready to take on any trip, from across New Hampton to across the country.",
